15 mins | Open Q&A | In delivering many workshops to date, we've found attendees always have many questions about Copilot including how it works, what languages are supported, how it can be used in their day-to-day work, etc. We recommend you allow time for this. Make sure you're familiar with the [differences](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing) between Copilot for Business and Copilot for Individuals.
